# Perturbation Theory: a Very Brief Introduction


Perturbation theory is a powerful mathematical tool that allows us to approximate and study quantum systems that we could not solve otherwise using direct calculations. The number of quantum systems that can be solved analytically are very few and they are mainly hypothetical, over simplified systems. For this reason, scientists have developed the perturbation theory, which consists of solving a complex problem by considering a simplified system (which we can compute the solution analytically) and treat the complex parts as perturbation to your simple problem. This method has been proven successful in explaining a myriad of phenomena, from the subatomic interactions to chemical bond. In this page, I will focus on the example of atomic orbitals to show some basics of how perturbation theory is useful.

Letâ€™s consider a PIB system with a barrier in the middle of the potential well. Consider the barrier to be of finite height and width as shown in the figure bellow.

In this case we can compute the wavefunction of the left well and the right well separately. Then we can use the wavefunction of the two wells as a basis for the total wavefunction. This can be mathematically expressed as $\psi_{tot} \approx c_{left} \psi_{left}+ c_{right} \psi_{right} $.

The wavefunctions of the separate wells are shown in the following figure. The figure shows three eigenstates for $n=1$, $n=2$ and $n=3$ (from lowest to highest in the figure).

The figure also shows two different linear combinations (for each value on $n$ ) of the right and left wavefunction to construct the total wavefunction. These linear combinations are shown in the figure bellow. The blue rectangles represent the coefficient of the left wavefunction ($c_{left}$) and the yellow rectangles represent the coefficient of the right wavefunction ($c_{right}$).
