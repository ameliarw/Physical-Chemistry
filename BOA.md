# Born-Oppenheimer Approximation ($H_2^+$)

So far in my analysis of quantum systems I have only considered systems with one particle or at most two particles (in the case of electric dipoles). In this page, I will take huge step and try a system of 3 particle. A na√Øve who is not familiar with quantum mechanics would think if we can solve a simple two-body system then we can scale our methods to any number of particle. Sadly, nature is not that nice and turns out that three-body problems (or many-body problems in general) in quantum mechanics are unsolvable analytically, and we have to resort to approximation technique to study these systems.
