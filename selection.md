# Selection Rules:

So far in my study I have explored the PIB system fairly deeply. I showed the showed how the energy of the particle is quantized and that the energy levels are equally separated. But this study is only relevant to an isolated system with no interaction. In reality, a quantum system will continuously undergo transitions between different energy levels spontaneously and with stimulations from the environment. A question that should be asked is: are all transitions between energy levels allowed? The simple answer is no. Transitions have to obey certain rules that originate from the laws of conservation of energy and momentum (both linear and angular momentum), these rules are called the selection rules. 

What makes a quantum system transition from one energy level to another? This ties back to light-matter interactions. To understand these interactions, we have to revisit the idea of electric dipoles ([see this link](/README.md)).
