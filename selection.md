# Selection Rules:

So far in my study I have explored the PIB system fairly deeply. I showed the showed how the energy of the particle is quantized and that the energy levels are equally separated. But this study is only relevant to an isolated system with no interaction. In reality, a quantum system will continuously undergo transitions between different energy levels spontaneously and with stimulations from the environment. A question that should be asked is: are all transitions between energy levels allowed? The simple answer is no. Transitions have to obey certain rules that originate from the laws of conservation of energy and momentum (both linear and angular momentum), these rules are called the selection rules. 

What makes a quantum system transition from one energy level to another? This ties back to light-matter interactions. To understand these interactions, we have to revisit the idea of electric dipoles ([see this link](/dipoles.md)). An electric dipole can represent the electron (negative part of the dipole) and the nucleus (positive part of the dipole) or a molecule. Each dipole has a natural frequency often referred to as $\omega_0$. If the frequency of the electric filed (the frequency of the light) is resonant with the natural frequency if the dipole $\omega=\omega_0$ then the light would be absorbed and this would trigger a vibration of the dipole. The further the frequency of light is from $\omega_0$ the less probable it is for light to be absorbed. Sound like we are getting closer to some rules of transitions isnâ€™t it?

To find the probability of a transition from a state $\psi_n$ to $\psi_m$ is given by the transition integral given by

<p align="center"> $\hat{P}e^{ikx}= -i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}e^{ikx}$. </p>
so
