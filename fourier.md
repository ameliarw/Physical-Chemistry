# Fourier Transform:
So far in my analysis of quantum systems, I have been mainly using the position basis. However, there are a lot of information that are hidden in other bases such as the momentum basis. Luckily, there is a powerful mathematical tool that can help us navigate easily between position and momentum bases. This mathematical tool is of course the glorious Fourier Transform. In this page, I will be introducing the basic math behind the Fourier transform and how it is helpful in physical chemistry.

The Fourier Transform decomposes a function into the sum of complex exponential function. These functions have different frequencies and form a basis. The idea on Fourier Transform is to express our original function in this new basis (a familiar approach to that we discussed [here](/ChangeofBasis.md)).

Letâ€™s explore the example of transforming a function from position space to momentum space.
