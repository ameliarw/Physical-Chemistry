# TFourier Transform:

So far in our analysis we have only been looking at the spatial dependence of our eigenvectors, $\psi(x)$. To understand the behavior of any real quantum system we have to determine both it spatial and time dependence. This means that we have to find the complete wavefunction, $\Psi(x,t)$. To do so we have to solve the time dependent Schr√∂edinger equation, TDSE:
<p align="center"> $H \Psi(x,t)= i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,t)$, </p>
where the Hamiltonian operator $H$ is still the sum of the potential and kinetic energy and $i$ is the complex number defined as $i=\sqrt{-1}$ ([click here](/complexnumbers.md) for a quick refresher on complex numbers). In this derivation we are adopting the position basis for our energy eigenvectors, meaning that the Hamiltonian is also expressed in the position basis.
