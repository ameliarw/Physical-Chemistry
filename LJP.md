# Lennard-Jones Potential:

The Lennard-Jones potential (L-J) is the potential governing the interactions between neutral atoms or molecules. It is mathematically given by 
$V_{L-J}=\epsilon [(\frac{\sigma}{x})^12-2(\frac{\sigma}{x})^6],$
where $\epsilon$ defines the depth of the well and $\sigma$ defines the position of the minimum value of the potential. The L-J is also called the $6-12$ potential (it should be obvious why it is called so by looking at the equation of the potential).
