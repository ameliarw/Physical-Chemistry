# Lennard-Jones Potential:

The Lennard-Jones potential (L-J) is the potential governing the interactions between neutral atoms or molecules. It is mathematically given by 
$V_{L-J}=\epsilon [(\frac{\sigma}{x})^12-2(\frac{\sigma}{x})^6],$
where $\epsilon$ defines the depth of the well and $\sigma$ defines the position of the minimum value of the potential. The L-J is also called the $6-12$ potential (it should be obvious why it is called so by looking at the equation of the potential).

Now letâ€™s consider a particle in the L-J potential. Its behavior should be similar to that of the SHO with some key differences. Fig.2 bellow shows 4 energy states of the system. First, we can see that the spacing between the energy levels decreases with increasing energy. We also see tunneling for states with energy lower than that of the potential, while for states with higher energy than the potential, the particle behaves almost like a free particle on the right side on the potential.
