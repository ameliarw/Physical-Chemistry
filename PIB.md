# Particle in a Box

The first quantum system we explore is the particle in a box (PIB) system. 
We restrict our study to a single particle (an electron) in a 1-dimentional box of width a=5nm.
The potential energy inside the box is set to 0. At the boundary, we set the potential energy to a value that we know will be higher than the particleâ€™s total energy, but also small enough to make the computation work.
The potential energy is then given by:

$V=\begin{cases} 0, & \mbox{if } 0<x<a \\\ 10^{-5}j, & \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}$

The potential in represented in the following figure.
