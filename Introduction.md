## Introduction to Quantum Mechanics Concepts Using Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is the natural language of quantum mechanics. So, it is crucial to begin our explorations by a quick refresher of the main ideas in linear algebra that are most relevant to our study.

Linear algebra allows us to express quantum states in vector forms. This, in my opinion, makes the ideas of orthogonality and normalization of wavefunctions more intuitive. We all know from introductory linear algebra what it means to normalize a vector and what orthogonal sets of vectors mean, here we will put our math background to some real scientific use.

### 1.1 Orthonormal basis
Consider a basis formed by the linearly independent vectors $|1>, |2>, |3>...|n>$ in a n-dimensional space, we can write any vector in this space as a linear combination of these vectors.
For example, we can write an arbitrary vector $|v>$ as 

<p align="center"> $|v>=v_1\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ 0 \\\ \vdots \\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}+v_2\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\ 1 \\\ \vdots \\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}+...v_n\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\ 0 \\\ \vdots \\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} v_{1} \\\ v_{2} \\\ \vdots \\\ v_{n} \end{bmatrix}$. </p>
and another vector $|w>$ as

<p align="center"> $|w>=w_1\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ 0 \\\ \vdots \\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}+w_2\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\ 1 \\\ \vdots \\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}+...w_n\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\ 0 \\\ \vdots \\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} w_{1} \\\ w_{2} \\\ \vdots \\\ w_{n} \end{bmatrix}$. </p>
We can also write $|v>$ and $|w>$ in a more formal and concise way as
 <p align="center">$|v>= \sum_{n=1}^{n}v_i |i> \ and \ |w>= \sum_{n=1}^{n}w_i |i> $. </p>

### 1.2 Inner Product
Inner products are ubiquitous in the realm of quantum mechanics. So it is important to have a quick refresher of inner products and get familiar with the notation we will be using in our study.

The inner product of $|v>$ and $|w>$ is defined as
<p align="center"> $<v,w>={\begin{bmatrix} v_{1} & v_{2} & ... & v_{n} \end{bmatrix}}^* \begin{bmatrix} w_{1} \\\ w_{2} \\\ \vdots \\\ w_{n} \end{bmatrix}=\sum_{n=1}^{n}v_i ^*w_i $.</p>
In quantum mechanics, the basis vectors $|1>, |2>... |n>$ represent the eigenvectors of quantum operators such as the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ or the momentum operator $\hat{P}$. These vectors are orthonormal, meaning that they are unit vectors and are mutually orthogonal. This can be mathematically summarized as
<p align="center"> $<i,j>=\begin{cases} 1 \ for \ i=j \\ 0 \ for \ i\neq j \end{cases} = \delta_{ij}$. </p>

### 1.3 Time Independent Schroedinger Equation (TISE)
The single most important piece of quantum mechanics is the TISE expressed as an eigenvalue equation

<p align="center"> $\hat{H}\psi=E\psi$, </p>
where $\psi$ is the eigenfunction of the system, $E$ is the value of the energy of the system and $\hat{H}=\hat{T}+\hat{V}$ is the Hamiltonian operator. $\hat{T}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$ for a one-dimentional system and $\hat{V}$, the potential energy operator, is described by the particular quantum system studied.

### 1.4 Quantum Operators
Quantum operators such as position, angular and linear momentum and the Hamiltonian, the total energy opertor, are all represented by matrices. These are square n by n matrices, where n depends on the quantization of the space and can be infinite.
So letâ€™s see one example of an operator matrix.

### 1.5 Constructing the Potential Energy Matrix
From the TISE, we know that the potential energy operator, $\hat{V}$ should be a matrix operating on the wavefunction represented by a vector $\psi$ of size n. So $\hat{V}$ should be a square matrix of size $n$. Now we need to know the entries of this square matrix. We know that operating the potential energy operator on a position eigenvector yields the value of the potential energy (eigenvalues) at the position represented by the vector. This means that when operating the potential energy matrix on the independent vectors $|1>, |2>, |3>...|n>$ we obtain $v_{11}|1>, v_{22}|2>, v_{33}|3>...v_{nn}|n>$, respectively.
Therefore, $\hat{V}$ must be a diagonal matrix of the form

<p align="center"> $\begin{bmatrix}
 v_{11} & 0 & & \cdots & & 0&  0 \\\
 0 & v_{22} & & \cdots & & 0&  0 \\\
 \vdots &  \vdots &  & \ddots & & \vdots & \vdots\\\
 0 & 0 & & \cdots & & v_{(n-1)(n-1)}&  0 \\\
0 & 0 & & \cdots & & 0&  v_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}$ </p>

For example, we can consider the potential shown in the figure bellow. We can express this potential energy in matrix for as

<p align="center"> $\hat{V}= \begin{bmatrix}
4& 0& 0& 0& 0&0 & 0\\\
0& 0& 0& 0& 0&0 & 0\\\
0& 0& 0& 0& 0&0 & 0\\\
0& 0& 0& 3& 0&0 & 0\\\
0& 0& 0& 0& 2&0 & 0\\\
0& 0& 0& 0& 0&0 & 0\\\
0& 0& 0& 0& 0&0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}$ </p>
