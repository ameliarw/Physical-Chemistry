## Complex numbers:

Complex numbers are common in advanced science classes. Here we give a short summery of the concepts that are needed for quantum theory.

Consider a complex number $z=a+ib$, where $i=\sqrt{-1}$. We call $a$ the real part of $z$ and $b$ its imaginary part. Therefore, any complex number can be plotted in the complex plane as follow.

The complex conjugate of $z$, denoted $z^* =a-ib$, is also very pertinent to quantum mechanics. For example the probability density $|\psi|^2= \psi^* \psi$, where $\psi^* $ is the complex conjugate of the wavefunction.  

We can also express the complex number $z$ in polar coordinates  as a function of $\theta$, the angle from the real axis, and $r$, the distance from the origin. Using polar coordinates, we have $z=re^{i\theta}$.

### Important Formulas and Identities:
Euler's formula
$e^{ix}=cos(x)+isin(x).\\\
cos(x)=\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2}.\\\
sin(x)=\frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i}.\\\
e^{ix}=e^{ix+2n\pi}$, where n is an integer.

All these identities can be summerized in one, probably the most important, eqaution in mathematics: the Euler's identity
