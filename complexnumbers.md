Complex numbers are common in advanced science classes. Here we give a short summery of the concepts that are needed for quantum theory.

Consider a complex number $z=a+ib$, we call $a$ the real part of $z$ and $b$ its imaginary part. Therefore, any complex number can be plotted in the complex plane as
