## Complex numbers:

Complex numbers are common in advanced science classes. Here we give a short summery of the concepts that are needed for quantum theory.

Consider a complex number $z=a+ib$, we call $a$ the real part of $z$ and $b$ its imaginary part. Therefore, any complex number can be plotted in the complex plane as follow.

The complex conjugate of $z$, denoted $z^* =a-ib$, is also very pertinent to quantum mechanics. For exapmle the probability density $|\psi|^2= \psi^8 \psi$, where $\psi^* $ is the complex conjugate of the wavefunction.  

We can also express the complex number $z$ in polar cooredines as a function of $\theta$, the angle  from the real axis, and $r$, the distance from the origin. Using polar coordinates, we have $z=re^{i\theta}$.
