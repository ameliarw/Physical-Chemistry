#Molecular Dynamics:

This is my final page and it will build on the knowledge accumulated through my whole project to study some simplified molecular dynamics. Consider three atoms A, B and C. For simplicity, let’s assume they are confined to only move in one direction, call it x-direction. Let’s assume the system starts with a molecule B-C and a separate atom A. The atom A approaches the molecule with some velocity $v$, the question I want to answer is A break the bond of B-C and for a molecule with either B or C? What are the requirements for such bond breaking/forming to occur? 

Each pair of the three particles will have a potential energy that looks like the Fig.2 of the previous page. So, we can express the potential of the system as a surface in function of the distances $r_{BC}$ and $r_{AB}$ (we do not need to worry about $r_{AC}$ since the atoms are on a line such that $r_{AC}$=$r_{AB}$+$r_{BC}$). The surface if shown in Fig.1 bellow.
