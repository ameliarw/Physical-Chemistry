## $1)$ Quantum Mechanics Using Linear Algebra
Taking a basis formed by linearly independent vectors $|1>, |2>, |3>... |n>$ in n-dimensional space, we can write any vector in this space as a linear combination of these vectors.\
We can then write vector $|v>$ as $|v>=\begin{bmatrix} v_{1} \\\ v_{2} \\\ \vdots \\\ v_{n} \end{bmatrix}$
