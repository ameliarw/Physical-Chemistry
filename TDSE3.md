## Perturbed Particle in a Box TDSE:

So far, all our calculations were based on a perfect 1-D infinit square potential well. Here, we will analyse the behavior of an electron in a PIB when we add a small (finite hight and width) barrier in the middle of the potential well. We start with probability distribution as a gaussian function of the form $e^{-a(x-b)^2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are both constant that determine the width and the center of the curve, respectively.
