# Electric Dipoles:

The electric dipole moment is a key to understanding light-matter interactions. It is proportional to the charge and the separation of two or more charged particles, and hence it is a way to measure the polarity of a system of charges. 

### 1) Permanent dipole moments:
Permanent diploe moments are not very relevant to light-matter interactions but they are the simplest way to introduce and understand dipoles. Consider two charged particles as shown in Fig.1. The separation between between the two charges is $d$ and they have charges of $+q$ and $-q$. The dipole moment is then given by
<p align="center">$\vec{\mu}=q\vec{d}$</p>

In general, if we have several charged particles, such as the example shown in Fig.2, we can express the electric dipole moment as
<p align="center">$\vec{\mu}=\sum_i q_i\vec{r}_i$</p>

### 2) Oscillating dipole:

Now that we developed a solid understanding of what electric diploes are, let’s consider the type of dipole we care about for light-matter interactions: the oscillating electric dipole.

We know that light is an electromagnetic wave (composed of a magnetic and an electric waves). Recall that an electric field attracts or repulses a charged particle depending on the charge of the particle and the direction of the electric field. Therefore, we expect that the electromagnetic field (light) will also have these interactions with a dipole (two or more charged particles). Let’s consider the simples system of a two particles dipole (one positive and one negative) with a light beam traveling orthogonal to the dipole. This system is shown in Fig.3. The figure shows how the electric field compresses and stretches the dipole. This is expected since when the electric field is positive it attracts the positive charge upward and pushes the negative charge downward, resulting in a stretched dipole. When the electric field is negative it pushes the positive charge downward and attracts the negative charge upwards, resulting in a compressed dipole. These compressions and stretches result in a vibration of the electric dipole moment.

<p align="center">Fig.3</p>

Notice that in the case of orthogonal beam (Fig.3) there is no net force applied on the dipole. If the light beam is not orthogonal to the dipole, then the forces on the two charges will not be equal and will result in a net force that would move the dipole or will result in torque that will rotates the dipole.

Let’s consider an example to better understand what I have shown so far. We can consider system made of a grounded proton and an electron confined in an infinite square well. The proton-electron system constitutes a dipole. When the electron is a stationary state then the expectation value of its position is fixed, hence the distance between the electron and the proton is fixed. In this case we have a fixed dipole. However, if the state of the electron is a linear combination of two or more stationary states, the expectation values of the position varies with time (as I have shown in the previous pages). In this case we have an oscillating dipole.
