# Electric Dipoles:

The electric dipole moment is a key to understanding light-matter interactions. It is proportional to the charge and the separation of two or more charged particles. It is then a way to measure the polarity of a system of charges. 

### 1) Permanent dipole moments:
Permanent diploe moments are not very relevant to light-matter interactions but they are the simplest way to introduce and understand diploe. Consider two charged particles as shown in Fig.1. The separation between the tween the two charges is $d$ and they have charges of $+q$ and $-q$. The dipole moment is then given by
<p align="center">$\vec{\mu}=q\vec{d}$</p>

In general, if we have several charged particles, such as the example shown in Fig.2, we can express the electric dipole moment as
<p align="center">$\vec{\mu}=\sum_i q_i\vec{r}_i$</p>
