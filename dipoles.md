# Electric Dipoles:

The electric dipole moment is a key to understanding light-matter interactions. It is proportional to the charge and the separation of two or more charged particles. It is then a way to measure the polarity of a system of charges. 

### 1) Permanent diploe moments:
Permanent diploe moments are not very relevant to light-matter interactions but they are the simplest way to introduce and understand diploe. Consider two charged particles as shown in Fig.1. The separation between the tween the two charges is $d$ and they have charges of $+q$ and $-q$. The dipole moment is then given by
