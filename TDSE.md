# Time Dependent Schroedinger equation:

So far in our analysis we have been only looking at the spacial dependence of our eigenvectors, $\psi(x)$. To understand the behavior of any real quantum system we have to determine both it spacial and time dependence. This means that we have to find the complete wavefunction, $\Psi(x,t)$. To do so we have to solve the time dependent Schroedinger equation, TDSE:
<p align="center"> $H \Psi(x,t)= i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,t)$, </p>
where the Hamiltonian operator $H$ is still the sum of the potential and kinetic energy. In this derivation we are adopting the position basis for our wavefunction, meaning that the Hamiltonian is also expressed in the position basis.
