# Time Dependent Schroedinger equation:

So far in our analysis we have been only looking at the spacial dependence of our eigenvectors, $\psi(x)$. To understand the behavior of any real quantum system we have to determine both it spacial and time dependence. This means that we have to find the complete wavefunction, $\Psi(x,t)$. To do so we have to solve the time dependent Schroedinger equation, TDSE:
<p align="center"> $H \Psi(x,t)= i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x,t)$. </p>
